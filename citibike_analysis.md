# What can NYC's Citi Bike data tell us about opening Citi Bike's in Des Moines, Iowa?

## NYC Citi Bike Analysis
In New York City, Citi Bike collected data from all rides during the month of August. It found that the total number of rides in August was 2,344,224 with the majority of those riders as subsription-based customers. 

Customers also mainly rode for an average of 17.5 minutes and the majority of the rides happened around peak commute hours between 6-9am and 4-7pm. 

## Relationsip to Des Moines
Although the overall population and population per square mile in Des Moines, is drastically smaller than that of New York City's, Des Moines still has a strong case for Citi Bikes. The percentage of the population between the ages of 18-65, working ages, is higher than New York Cities. Mainly, people between working ages in New York were subscribers, and due to the peak hour of use being major commute hours in NYC, it is reasonable to believe that most rides were taken after work or to work. In Des Moines, there are many bike trails, and the average commute to work is 19 minutes compared to New York's average commute of 41 minutes. There could be a huge potential for ridership to and from work in Des Moines. 

### Considerations
Because Des Moines' population is smaller than New York's, the overall profits from Citi Bike would most likely be smaller than that of NYC. Also, like New York, it snows during winter in Des Moines, so it would be helpful to have the data from winter months to make a more informed decision. Des Moines is also not as bustling as New York City. This may help encourage more people to ride bikes, but since there are less shops within a smaller radius, people may be more inclined to drive. Additionally, people in New York may be incentivized to bike because of long commute times in either the car or underground train. In Des Moines, the 19 minute commute average could be primarily in the car and people may not want a longer commute time that could come from biking. Overall, althought the profit margins may not be as high as New York, there is a strong potential for subscribers in the workforce.
